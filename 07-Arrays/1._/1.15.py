# Bubble sort
#Define a function that sorts an array of numbers using the bubble sort algorithm. Use the information in the pseudocode provided earlier. Then, write a program that sorts the following collections of data:

car_fuel_consumption = [7.2, 6.8, 7.5, 7.0, 7.1, 6.9, 7.3]
bank_transactions = [-150, -20, 300, -45, -60, 500, -120]
def bubble_sort(arr):
    i=0
    n = range(len(arr)-1,0,-1)

    for i in n:
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[j]>arr[j+1]:
                arr[j],arr[j+1]=arr[j+1],arr[j]
    return arr

car_fuel_consumption = [7.2, 6.8, 7.5, 7.0, 7.1, 6.9, 7.3]
print(car_fuel_consumption)
sorted_car_fuel_consumption = bubble_sort(car_fuel_consumption) 
print(sorted_car_fuel_consumption)

bank_transactions = [-150, -20, 300, -45, -60, 500, -120]
print(bank_transactions)
sorted_bank_transactions = bubble_sort(bank_transactions)
print(sorted_bank_transactions)
